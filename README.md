# Evaluating The Trade-Off Between Performance And Carbon Emission In Wind Power Forecasting

This repository contains code for my MSc CS research project. The code focuses on a wind power dataset from the KDD CUP 2022, and it includes analysis of the 3rd place and 11th place of the competition.

## To work with the repository

1. Make two folders: models/KDDCUP2022_BERT and models/KDDCUP2022_GNN in the root where contents of the 3rd place and 11th place Githubs are placed.
2. Put the official competition dataset in a new folder data/ in the root
